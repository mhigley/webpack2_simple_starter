## Webkit2 Simple Starter

#### What's included you ask?
* .babelrc - Ready for all you ES6/7/8/etc configuration needs.
* .gitignore - Protecting the world from all the yucky files no one wants to see.
* package.json - Your Push to Start file!
* readme.md - This very file!!
* webpack.config.js - The brains behind the brawn.

### Anything else?
* Your very own styles folder that holds all of your SASSy styles. That's right... this starter is souped up for SASS!
* A personalized JavaScript folder for containing your scripting awesomeness!
* The aptly names imgs folder. For images. Novel.

### And?
What do you mean "And?"

Fire it up with an `npm install` and bask in your glory. Once all the goodness has downloaded, all you need to do is `npm start` and you're off to the races. Happy dev-ing!
